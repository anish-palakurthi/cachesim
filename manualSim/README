# Cache Simulator

## Usage Instruction

Run ./run.sh to output for all 15 test cases for associativites 2, 4, and 8
To run a single test, run cachesim.py with the dinero trace file path as a parameter in the command line

To generate a more comprehensive data table for each run, run tableGen.py. This will output a .xlsx file to view the data.

cachesim.py runs our main cache logic and is what should be used/examined.
tableGen.py is similar but generates a pandas dataframe with all the output included via an .xlsx file.
